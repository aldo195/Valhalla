“Don’t be a security sucker. Enter Valhalla.”

In Short
Quantitatively measure the effectiveness of your security team.


How It Works
Choose a measurement question from the list, such as “How long until my security team notices an antivirus detection on a server?” (we call this a raid)
Fill out the raid creation form, such as server name and authentication details
Download the raid file when prompted
Run the raid file on your computer
Watch the timer while you wait for your security team to notify you about the incident
Stop the timer once your security team notifies you about the incident
