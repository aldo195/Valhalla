<h1>Valhalla</h1>

“Don’t be a security sucker. Enter Valhalla.”

<h2>In Short</h2>
Quantitatively measure the effectiveness of your security team.

<h2>How It Works</h2>
1. Choose a measurement question from the list, such as “How long until my security team notices an antivirus detection on a server?” (we call this a raid)
2. Fill out the raid creation form, such as server name and authentication details
3. Download the raid file when prompted
4. Run the raid file on your computer
5. Watch the timer while you wait for your security team to notify you about the incident
6. Stop the timer once your security team notifies you about the incident

<h2>Functional Capabilities</h2>
* Generating a PowerShell script to run privileged Windows commands inside network
* Listening for HTTPS connections to simulate encrypted communication between host inside the network and a remote server
* Accepting IP connections at a hosted server in Ukraine
* Sending customized emails to simulate phishing attempts
* Providing dummy malware binaries containing strings to trigger specific antivirus detections
* Simulating exploit kit attack using Metasploit

<h2>How Long Until My Security Team Notices..</h2>

<h3>Reconnaissance</h3>
* Port scanning of externally facing systems
* Port scanning inside the network
* RDP brute-force inside the network

<h3>Weaponization</h3>
* Highly targeted spear-phishing email attack

<h3>Delivery</h3>
* An email attachment containing an APT dropper is blocked at the mail server
* An end-user is repeatedly blocked from accessing malicious websites

<h3>Exploitation</h3>
* An attempt to dump cached Windows passwords using Mimikatz
* An exploit kit attack is blocked at an endpoint

<h3>Installation</h3>
* An antivirus detection on a server
* An antivirus detection on a workstation
* A webshell backdoor on a web server
* Presence of a publicized RAT’s keys in Windows Registry 

<h3>Command and Control</h3>
* DNS lookups to domains associated with a banking trojan every hour 
* IP connections to a web server in Ukraine every minute 

<h3>Actions on Objectives</h3>
* NBNS scanning from a server
* Lateral movement using psexec
* Massive data exfiltration through FTP to remote server
* Massive data exfiltration through DNS protocol abuse

<h2>System Architecture</h2>
* Web Server
* Database
